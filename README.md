1. **[Even Vs Odd](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A1%20-%201%20Even%20Vs%20Odd.ipynb)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and identifies whether it is an even or odd number.
2. **[Mark Sheet Printer](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A1%20-%202%20Mark%20Sheet.ipynb)**
This program takes as input: no. of subjects, name of each subject, total possible marksin each subject, total obtained marks in each subject and prints the marks sheet.
### Assignment - 2 (Dated: 23-July-2022)
2. **[Multiplication Table Printer](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%201%20Table%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and prints the multiplication table of the specified integer from 1 - 10.
3. **[Random Numbers](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%202%20Random%20Numbers.ipynb)**
This program can generate any amount/quantity of random numbers between any desired range. It can also perform following analyses on the random numbers:
	- Sum and average
	- Maximum and minimum numbers
	- Frequency of numbers that are greater than 40
	- Sum of numbers greater than 40
4. **[Guess Game Using Loops & Break](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%203%20Loops%20%26%20Break.ipynb)**
This program generates a random integer between 1 & 10 and then asks the user to guess the number. It gives three lifes to a user.
5. **[Common Elements among Two Lists](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%204%20Common%20Elements%20between%20lists.ipynb)**
This program generates two random lists of desired parameters. It then automatically finds the common elements among the two random lists.
6. **[Alphabet Frequency in a Statement/List](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%205%20Character%20Repititons%20in%20a%20Statement.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts how many times a particular alphabet is repeated in that text.
### Assignment - 3 (Dated: 30-July-2022)
7. **[Vowels and Consonants Count](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%201%20Vowels%20and%20Consonants.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts number of vowels and consonants in that statement.
8. **[Reverse Triangle Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%202%20Reverse%20Triangle%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program inputs a number from a user and prints a reverse triangle pattern.
9. **[Character Count 2.0](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%203%20Character%20Counter.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and individually counts each character repeated in that statement.
10. **[Palindrome Check](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%204%20Palindrome%20Tester.ipynb)**
This program inputs a string/number from a user and checks where it is palindrome or not.
11. **[Diamond Shape Pattern Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%205%20Diamond%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program inputs a number from a user and prints diamond shape pattern.
