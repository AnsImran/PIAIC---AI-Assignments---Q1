## Quarter 1 - Assignments
1. **[Even Vs Odd](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A1%20-%201%20Even%20Vs%20Odd.ipynb)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and identifies whether it is an even or odd number.
2. **[Mark Sheet Printer](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A1%20-%202%20Mark%20Sheet.ipynb)**
This program takes as input: no. of subjects, name of each subject, total possible marksin each subject, total obtained marks in each subject and prints the marks sheet.
### Assignment - 2 (Dated: 23-July-2022)
2. **[Multiplication Table Printer](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%201%20Table%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and prints the multiplication table of the specified integer from 1 - 10.
3. **[Random Numbers](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%202%20Random%20Numbers.ipynb)**
This program can generate any amount/quantity of random numbers between any desired range. It can also perform following analyses on the random numbers:
	- Sum and average
	- Maximum and minimum numbers
	- Frequency of numbers that are greater than 40
	- Sum of numbers greater than 40
4. **[Guess Game Using Loops & Break](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%203%20Loops%20%26%20Break.ipynb)**
This program generates a random integer between 1 & 10 and then asks the user to guess the number. It gives three lifes to a user.
5. **[Common Elements among Two Lists](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%204%20Common%20Elements%20between%20lists.ipynb)**
This program generates two random lists of desired parameters. It then automatically finds the common elements among the two random lists.
6. **[Alphabet Frequency in a Statement/List](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%205%20Character%20Repititons%20in%20a%20Statement.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts how many times a particular alphabet is repeated in that text.

### Assignment - 3 (Dated: 30-July-2022)
7. **[Vowels and Consonants Count](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%201%20Vowels%20and%20Consonants.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts number of vowels and consonants in that statement.
```
Enter a statement: aEi    Ou qw rt p s 1234567890 ./,;'][!@#$%`~



The list of Vowels    is:  ['a', 'E', 'i', 'O', 'u']

The number of vowels  is:  5



The list of Consonants    is:  ['q', 'w', 'r', 't', 'p', 's']

The number of Consonants  is:  6
```
8. **[Reverse Triangle Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%202%20Reverse%20Triangle%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program inputs a number from a user and prints a reverse triangle pattern.
```
Enter the number whose triangle you want to print: 9

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
1 2 3 4 5 6 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 
1 2 
1 
```

9. **[Character Count 2.0](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%203%20Character%20Counter.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and individually counts each character repeated in that statement.
```
Enter a statement: A bB ccC dddD eeeeE fffffF  .. ~ 99
The character [A] is repeated 1 times
 
The character [ ] is repeated 9 times
 
The character [B] is repeated 2 times
 
The character [C] is repeated 3 times
 
The character [D] is repeated 4 times
 
The character [E] is repeated 5 times
 
The character [F] is repeated 6 times
 
The character [.] is repeated 2 times
 
The character [~] is repeated 1 times
 
The character [9] is repeated 2 times
```
10. **[Palindrome Check](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%204%20Palindrome%20Tester.ipynb)**
This program inputs a string/number from a user and checks where it is palindrome or not.
```
Enter a word, date, statement or sentence to see if it is a palindrome or not: Nurses Run

The list of relevant alphabets and numbers is: 
 ['n', 'u', 'r', 's', 'e', 's', 'r', 'u', 'n']

The left  list is:  ['n', 'u', 'r', 's']
The right list is:  ['e', 's', 'r', 'u', 'n']

Since the total number of relevant alphabets/numbers was odd, so, the new truncated right list is:  ['s', 'r', 'u', 'n']

The reversed right list is:  ['n', 'u', 'r', 's']


Since, the left list and the reversed right list are equal, therefore, THIS IS A PALINDROME





Enter a word, date, statement or sentence to see if it is a palindrome or not: 02/02/2020

The list of relevant alphabets and numbers is: 
 ['0', '2', '0', '2', '2', '0', '2', '0']

The left  list is:  ['0', '2', '0', '2']
The right list is:  ['2', '0', '2', '0']

The reversed right list is:  ['0', '2', '0', '2']


Since, the left list and the reversed right list are equal, therefore, THIS IS A PALINDROME





Enter a word, date, statement or sentence to see if it is a palindrome or not: My name is Ans Imran 

The list of relevant alphabets and numbers is: 
 ['m', 'y', 'n', 'a', 'm', 'e', 'i', 's', 'a', 'n', 's', 'i', 'm', 'r', 'a', 'n']

The left  list is:  ['m', 'y', 'n', 'a', 'm', 'e', 'i', 's']
The right list is:  ['a', 'n', 's', 'i', 'm', 'r', 'a', 'n']

The reversed right list is:  ['n', 'a', 'r', 'm', 'i', 's', 'n', 'a']


Since, the left list and the reversed right list are not equal, therefore, THIS IS NOT A PALINDROME
```
11. **[Diamond Shape Pattern Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%205%20Diamond%20Printer.ipynb)**
