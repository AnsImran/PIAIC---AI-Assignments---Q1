This program takes an integer number from the user and identifies whether it is an even or odd number.
2. **[Mark Sheet Printer](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A1%20-%202%20Mark%20Sheet.ipynb)**

### Assignment - 2 (Dated: 23-July-2022)
2. **[Printing Multiplication Table](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%201%20Table%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program takes an integer number from the user and a number up to which multiplication table is required. Multiplication table is printed as an output.
3. **[Finding Variables using Loops](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%202%20Random%20Numbers.ipynb)**
This program generates 100 random numbers between 10 and 90 and store them in a separate array and computes the following:
	- Sum and average of 100 random numbers
	- Maximum and minimum numbers
	- Count of numbers that are greater than 40
	- Sum of numbers greater than 40
4. **[Guess Game](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%203%20Loops%20%26%20Break.ipynb)**
This program generates a random integer between 1 & 10 and then asks user to guess the number three times.
5. **[Common Elements among Two Lists](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%204%20Common%20Elements%20between%20lists.ipynb)**
This program identifies common elements among two given lists and stores them in a separate array.
6. **[Character Count](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A2%20-%205%20Character%20Repititons%20in%20a%20Statement.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts how many times a particular character is repeated in that text.
### Assignment - 3 (Dated: 30-July-2022)
7. **[Vowels and Consonants Count](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%201%20Vowels%20and%20Consonants.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and counts number of vowels and consonants in that statement.
8. **[Reverse Triangle Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%202%20Reverse%20Triangle%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program inputs a number from a user and prints a reverse pyramid pattern.
9. **[Character Count 2.0](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%203%20Character%20Counter.ipynb)**
This program inputs a statement from a user and individually counts each character repeated in that statement.
10. **[Palindrome Check](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%204%20Palindrome%20Tester.ipynb)**
This program inputs a string/number from a user and checks where it is palindrome or not.
11. **[Diamond Shape Pattern Printing](https://github.com/AnsImran/PIAIC---AI-Assignments---Q1/blob/main/A3%20-%205%20Diamond%20Printer.ipynb)**
This program inputs a number from a user and prints diamond shape pattern.
